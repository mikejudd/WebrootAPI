Taken from Webroot API forums user AdamCMorgan

This one exports a csv of all endpoints in all sites, sorted by SiteName, MACAddress, and LastSeen.  Should help locate duplicates that need to be deleted from GSM.  Just open the result in Excel, highlight the MACAddress column, and select "Conditional Formatting, Highlight Cells Rules, Duplicate Values".
Note: This contains many commented blocks of code that you can remove for the sake of tidyness.  I left them there in-case they help any learners such as myself.
